1. Configuration (config.py):
The config.py file stores configuration parameters such as the database file, secret key, and 2Factor API key. This file centralizes the configuration, making it easy to manage.

2. Database Handling (db_handler.py):
The DBHandler class is responsible for handling operations related to the user database. It has two main methods:

authenticate_user: Takes a mobile number and OTP, reads the user data from the Excel database, and checks if the provided mobile number and OTP match any user. If a match is found, it returns the user data; otherwise, it returns None.

save_user_data: Takes user data (mobile number and OTP) and appends it to the Excel database. This method is used during the signup process to save user information.

3. OTP Handling (otp_handler.py):
The OTPHandler class interacts with the 2Factor service to send OTPs and provides OTP verification. It has two methods:

send_otp: Takes a mobile number and OTP, constructs a URL to send an SMS through the 2Factor API, and makes a request to send the OTP. It returns the response from the 2Factor service.

verify_otp: Takes a mobile number and OTP and performs a simple verification (for demo purposes). In a real-world scenario, you would replace this with more secure OTP verification logic.

4. Flask App (app.py):
The main Flask application has three routes:

/send_otp: Accepts a POST request with a mobile number. It generates a random OTP (for demo purposes), sends it using the OTPHandler, and returns a response.

/signup: Accepts a POST request with a mobile number and OTP. It verifies the OTP, authenticates the user using the DBHandler, and saves user data if the user is not already registered. It then returns a JWT token.

/login: Accepts a POST request with a mobile number and OTP. It verifies the OTP and authenticates the user using the DBHandler. If successful, it returns a JWT token.

Workflow:
The client initiates the signup process by sending a POST request to /send_otp with the mobile number.
The server generates an OTP, sends it using the 2Factor service, and responds with a success or error message.
The client sends a POST request to /signup with the mobile number and the received OTP.
The server verifies the OTP, authenticates the user, saves user data if needed, and returns a JWT token.
For login, the process is similar, but the client sends a POST request to /login instead.

This example uses simplified logic for OTP verification and does not include robust error handling. In a production environment, you would need to enhance security and error handling based on your application's requirements.
